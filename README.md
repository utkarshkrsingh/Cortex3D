<h3 align="center">Context-Aware 3D Reconstruction</h3>

Creating 3D models from 2D images is a key challenge in computer vision.  
Traditional methods often struggled with:

- Smooth and realistic surface generation  
- Occlusions (parts of the object being hidden)  
- Difficult lighting and viewing conditions  

Early deep learning models processed images **one at a time**, which introduced limitations:

- The final 3D model depended on the order of the images  
- Important details from earlier views were often lost

### Our Approach

Cortex3D processes **all images simultaneously**, ensuring the reconstruction is independent of image order and uses every detail effectively.

1. **Initial Reconstruction** – A neural network generates rough 3D models from individual images.  
2. **Smart Fusion** – These initial models are intelligently combined.  
   - *Example:* Use the front view for a car’s headlights and the side view for its doors.  
3. **Final Refinement** – A cleanup network corrects errors and produces a polished, accurate 3D model.

Our goal is to build a system that:

- Handles occlusions gracefully  
- Makes the most of every available image  
- Produces **accurate, realistic, and reliable 3D reconstructions**
